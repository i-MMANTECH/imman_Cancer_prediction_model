### Cancer Prediction Model using Naive Bayes Algorithm

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting cancer using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Developed in Python, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate method for early cancer detection by analyzing medical data. The model leverages the probabilistic nature of Naive Bayes to classify data and predict the likelihood of cancer presence.

**Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results and performance metrics

**Dependencies:**
- Python (version X.X)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train and evaluate the model.
